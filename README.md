# Learning in 2017 A Review

End of the year is a great time to re-evaluate what we have done this year. This talk and presentation is all about understanding what is it that we can do to 
- Review what we did this year
- Review what we thought we would do, but didn't do this year

Some ideas on how to understand why we may have not done what we thought we would do.

> This isn't strictly a technical talk. But I believe this is a really important one. We all would like to learn new things in security and always think about how to improve. The work that we do in this talk and workshop will allow us to do this in a manner that is

- Specific
- Measurable
- Result oriented, Realistic &
- Community Driven

## Outcomes and Objectives
1. You will leave the talk with a basic review of your learning in 2017
2. You will gain insight into what stopped you from completing all that you wanted to in terms of learning
3. Based on our limitations, we see how communities such as [null0x00](https://null.co.in), [OWASP Bangalore](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bangalore) and [Garage4Hackers](http://www.garage4hackers.com) can play an important part in enabling its members to do active learning
4. You will discover that the community can provide multiple ways to get people together to collaborate and learn
